# 1.3.0 Patch Notes - Wave 3.5: A Crack In Time
- Yeah we're doing a half wave
- Still added more content than the entirety of some other mods lmao goes hard
- Suppressed Cracked Emoji.
- +16 items and +1 equipment
- Well technically -1 item too since we turned bottled metamorphosis into an equipment
- Including equips, the total item count is now 100. We are the first item mod to reach 100 items let's fucking joe!
- Crown Prince noew becomes Crown Prince.exe upon being consumed, allowing it to retain the debuff even after all 50 lives are used up.
- Fixed an oversight with Shrines of Disposability that caused them to never stop firing
- Using Shrine of Disposability while the missiles are in use no longer adds another stream, and the missiles are instead added to the current stream's backlog. DML shrine is supposed to be shit, so this is one of the things we did to nerf it.
- Interactables can now be disabled in the configs. About fucking time.
- Zany Soup now doubles more items

- Fixed some bugs relating to war crimes.
- Nerfed the melee hitbox increase from the AOE effect stat to be more reasonable.

- Fixed bugs related to visual effects not appearing.
- Thes are now only stunned if an attack would deal damage equal to or higher than the The's maximum health.
- Thes now receive heavy knockback upon being stunned
- Living Suppressive Fires now apply the weaken debuff on hit and have slayer, allowing them to potentially actually do something.
- Buffed the base damages on Living Suppressive Fire and Cracked Vermin.

- Various other changes and bugfixes.
- Suppressed the Cracked Emoji

# 1.2.0 Patch Notes - Wave 3: The Crackening Part 1
- Added over 30 new items, bringing the item count all the way up to a staggering 88, including equipments.
- Added 8 new enemies, for a total of 11! This means that GOTCE is now the largest enemy mod currently.
- Added 12 new alt skills to a variety of survivors. Our goal with these alt skills is to generally make somewhat well-made alt skills to fill in slots that don't have alts, like commando m1 or all of viend. Of course, not all of these skills will be serious, like for railgunner and lodr because fuck them lmao
- Added a new tier 1 elite called Compartmentalized Elites. They have 3 extra charges and 50% reduced cooldown on their secondary skill (if they have one), and disable your secondary skill on hit for a few seconds.
- Added 2 new shitty artifacts
- Added the new Cracked Commando survivor!
- Fixed an oversight that caused the Wave 2 enemies to spawn much less frequently, or not at all in the case of Living Suppressive Fire. Whoops lmao. I guess this technically means that you're getting 11 new enemies because the 3 from Wave 2 were basically fake.
- New mechanic: Critical Sprints - Every time you initiate a sprint with any amount of Sprint Crit Chance, you will critically sprint, doubling your speed.
- New mechanic: AOE Effect - AOE effect increases the sizes of blast attacks, orb ranges, and overlap attacks (aka melee hitboxes). Bang Snap has been reworked to give you +2 AOE effect instead of increasing the size of blast attacks by 2 meters. This means that Bang Snap is significantly more useful.
- New mechanic: War Crimes - Various actions will cause you to commit a war crime, with your most recent one being tracked. These include using certain skills, using certain items, or killing mending cores, which specifically counts as killing medical personnel.
- Nerfed Cracked Pest aoe and damage
- Added configs for enemies
- Added config presets that disable all items with certain item tags, namely unstable (lag and crashing), bullshit (extremely stupid items), and a few others I forgor about
- Implemented unlocks for alt skills (most of them at least, we haven't finished them all). They can be disabled in the configs in order to not have to unlock the skill.
- The void lunar tier is actually real now and has a custom background color in the logbook.
- Same goes for the boss equipment tier.
- With the proper implementation of the boss equip tier, Void Donut will no longer appear in the normal equipment pool. No more Void Donut from an equipment barrel for you!
- Drastically increased measures against any slab revival. It will fucking stay dead. Fuck the slab.
- Fixed some bugs here and there, probably.
- Also probably some minor buffs and nerfs, maybe? I kinda forgor tbh.
- Hello World now properly throws NREs every frame, instead of once every recalcstats
- Monster's Visage now has a range indicator.
- All items are now able to be disabled in the config.
- Pretty sure Pale Ale is real now?
